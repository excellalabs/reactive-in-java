# Curriculum: Reactive Programming with Reactor and Spring Boot

Curriculum for learning reactive programming in Java, specifically with Spring Boot and Reactor

## Curriculum

* Basics of streams, event loop
* Reactor
* Fluxes and Monos
* Operators
* Patterns: Higher order functions, currying, etc.
* Use cases for Reactor approaches (i.e. zips, tuples)

## Training Materials

* Reactor Cheat Sheet

- [Reactor Reference Guide](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/) - key resource to learning Reactor

- [When to use what operator](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/index.html#which-operator) - appendix to the Reference Guide that is very helpful

- [Reactor's Learning Material](https://projectreactor.io/learn)

- [Reactive in Spring (video)](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/reactive-spring/9781492025733/9781492025733-video317125) - This has about **40 minutes** of video going over reactive and how Reactor is the default implementation in spring boot, and then gets into it. Key sections: 
  - The Reactive Streams Spec
  - Project Reactor
  - Flux and Mono
  - Using the Flux and Mono Methods
  - Reactive Streams and the Spring-Webflux Module

- [Building RESTful Web Services with Spring 5 (book)](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-restful-web/9781788475891/)

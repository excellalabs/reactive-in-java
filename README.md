# Curricula: Reactive Programming with Reactor and Spring Boot, and Related Material

Curriculum for learning reactive programming in Java, specifically with Spring Boot and Reactor, with a front-end in React

This will probably be broken up into subpages by the `Curricula` sections, but for now we're trying to get key topics enumerated so people are aware of the landscape they need to know, with key resources to go through (in minimal amount of time), and eventually exercises / app to build to reinforce learning (NOTE: repo is poorly named right as now as it started out focused on reactive).

NOTE: A lot of these resources come from Safari, which requires a subscription which is highly recommended (trials available).

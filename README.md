# Curricula: Reactive Programming with Reactor

A guided curriculum with all the core resources to learn reactive programming in Java, specifically with Spring Boot microservices and Reactor.

NOTE: A lot of these resources come from Safari, which requires a subscription which is highly recommended (trials available). *This is a work-in-progress. [TODO items](todo.md)*

--- 

**Instructions:** *Go through each curriculum, and go through the resources and complete the relelated exercises. You can fork this repo to track your process using the checkboxes.*

* [ ] [Modern and Functional Java](curric-java.md#Java-Foundation-for-Reactive)
* [ ] [Reactive Programming & Reactor](curric-java.md#Reactive-and-Reactor-Curriculum)

**Beta** 

These are very relevant areas as well, and this is a WIP compilation of their curricula:

* [ ] [Distributed Systems & Microservices](curric-spring-boot-microservices.md)
* [ ] [Microservices with Spring Boot](curric-spring-boot-microservices.md#Spring-and-Spring-Boot)

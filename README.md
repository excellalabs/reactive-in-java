# Curricula: Reactive Programming with Reactor and Spring Boot, and Related Material

Curriculum for learning reactive programming in Java, specifically with Spring Boot and Reactor, with a front-end in React

This will probably be broken up into subpages by the `Curricula` sections, but for now we're trying to get key topics enumerated so people are aware of the landscape they need to know, with key resources to go through (in minimal amount of time), and eventually exercises / app to build to reinforce learning (NOTE: repo is poorly named right as now as it started out focused on reactive).

NOTE: A lot of these resources come from Safari, which requires a subscription which is highly recommended (trials available).

## [TODO](todo.md)

## Curricula Overview

* Getting Started with Reactor
  * Basics of streams, event loop
  * Reactor
  * Fluxes and Monos
  * Operators
  * Patterns: Higher order functions, currying, etc.
  * Use cases for Reactor approaches (i.e. zips, tuples)
* Spring Boot
* Java language, patterns and architecture
* Distributed Systems
* Front-end with React

# Getting Started with Reactor

## Learning 

- [Reactive in Spring (video)](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/reactive-spring/9781492025733/9781492025733-video317125) - This has about **40 minutes** of video going over reactive and how Reactor is the default implementation in spring boot, and then gets into it. It's a good place to start, to get an overview. Key sections: 
  - The Reactive Streams Spec
  - Project Reactor
  - Flux and Mono
  - Using the Flux and Mono Methods
  - Reactive Streams and the Spring-Webflux Module

- Read through the [Reactor Reference Guide & Docs](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/) - this is a key resource to learning Reactor, with the needed depth
  
  Additional key materials from the docs:
  - [When to use what operator](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/index.html#which-operator) - appendix to the Reference Guide that is very helpful
  - [Reactor's Learning Material](https://projectreactor.io/learn) - material they provide to learn, including exercises
